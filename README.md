# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahmed Shawky

🎯 **Senior Mobile Engineer | Flutter & Native (Swift/Kotlin) | Mobile Architecture Enthusiast**

I'm a passionate software engineer with over **5 years of experience** building high-performance, scalable, and user-focused **mobile applications**. I specialize in **Flutter**, with a strong background in **native Android (Kotlin)** and **iOS (Swift)** development.

I focus on building not just apps, but complete systems — emphasizing **architecture**, **scalability**, **real-time experiences**, and **clean code practices**.
